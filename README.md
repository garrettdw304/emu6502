# Emu6502
Emu6502 is a W65C02 emulator. 3 projects are included, 1 as the actual emulator library, 1 as a CLI used mostly for testing the emulator library and 1 as a GUI which utilizes the emulator library to implement a simple 6502 based machine.

This project is still very much in progress and is mostly for my own pleasure and educational purposes, therefore I make no promises of what the final product will include or look like or any kind of timeline for any of it.

Currently the cpu passes all of the Klaus (https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests) tests.

Like most young people that have an interest in the 6502, I thank Ben Eater (https://eater.net/) for his work!
